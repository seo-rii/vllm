"""Capability model for dedicated-device speculator placement.

A speculator can only move to a dedicated GPU outside the target TP group
when all of its runtime state can be reconstructed from transported target
features (target-conditioned, own-KV). Compatibility is decided from an
explicit capability object reported by the standalone server for the actual
adapter and checkpoint, never from the speculative method name alone.
